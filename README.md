# H2Mtranslation
This code is part of a research projecy effort in [Elhanan Bronstein Lab - TLV university, Israel](https://borensteinlab.sites.tau.ac.il/). We try to address the question: How we can translate mice to human microbiome? Taking into account multi-omic data, such as metabolome, above the host taxonomic microbiome data. We wish to find a quality mapping between hosts taxa, that preserve information about the hosts multi-omic (such as the metabolome). AKA we wish to translate between mice microbiome community to human's community in a way that will preserve the relation between the microbiome taxonomic and other omic's such as the metabolome. 

For a summary review of this work, please have a look at [these slides](https://github.com/MarkNoaTAU/H2Mtranslation/blob/main/Translation%20of%20microbiome-phenotype%20association%20between%20hosts.pdf).
