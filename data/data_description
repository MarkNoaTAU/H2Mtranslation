Each experiment will be under it's own directory (data/exp_name).
In data/exp_name there will be directory called 'original' which will contain (only) the relevant files from the
experiment as we got them from the authors. As well as 3 independent files, which we created from them:
1. Feature table of samples x Taxonomic species
2. Feature table of samples x metabolites (molecule annotation)
3. Meta-data mapping sample-id to control/not-control, host identity, number of sample from this host.

There are other metadata and data about the metabolite annotation that will not be included in our extracted files
(such as confidence level of the annotation). Also, we drop missing annotations and outliers.
